# Contact-Tracing
A C++ project designed to record users' contacts and movements on a daily basis and allow the organization to detect risky locations and potential Covid-19 carriers.

In particular, the user can:
  1. Add details about new contacts they made or places they visited
  2. Modify their records
  3. Remove any unwanted contacts or travelling
  4. View their records

The control center can:
  1. Search who was at a specified location during a given period of time.
  2. Search contacts of a person and people who were in contact with those contacts to quickly determine possible covid-19 carriers.
  3. Search who were the most contacted with a given list of covid-19 carriers to quickly identify the potential F0
